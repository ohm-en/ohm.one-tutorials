This tutorial shows you have to setup Portmaster in a whitelist mode for Obsidian. The same principles apply to any other application.

1. Follow the instructions found on it's [website](https://safing.io/portmaster/) to install Portmaster.
2. Go to "App Settings" as seen below.

3. By default it says, "Obsidian is fully using the global settings. Start creating exceptions for it now."; so, click edit settings.
4. As seen in the picture below, change the "Default Network Action" to "Prompt".

    5. Now every request made by Obsidian will be blocked unless whitelist, and whenever a request (without a rule) gets blocked, you'll receive a notification like the one below.

    6. For example, if you want to access the Community tabs in Obsidian, allow `raw.githubusercontent.com`. You shouldn't be asked again.
